# Lowkey-TestTask

Hello to the team at Lowkey!
Thank you for providing the opportunity to vie for a place in your team.
To complete this test task, I used my framework, [MaxUI](https://github.com/Xopoko/MaxUI). I decided to use it when I saw in the job description that you are using SwiftUI and UIKit in the project, and thought it would be perfect to use my own framework.
For your convenience, I have left my API key in the code.
